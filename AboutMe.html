      <p class="aboutmepstyle"> I'm an incoming junior at Orleans Jr. Sr. High School.
        My daily life is pretty consistent with what you'll see anywhere else, other than the school size is a lot smaller.
        I always strive to be better than I was the day before, regradless of what the application of my skills are.  This probably stems from my competitive
        nature.<br><br>

        My coding journey started back in 2018,
        or in my 6th grade year when I first learned about how the games I played everyday were created. 
        This really sparked a fire under me to figure out how it worked.  My first real project with JavaScript
        started in 2021, when I took my school's computer science class. In that class, I created a website, 
        a very simple JavaScript app, and learned about the fair use laws.</p>
