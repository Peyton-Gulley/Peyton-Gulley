      <!--(In a new column) Information about how I started coding-->
      <p class="aboutmep">I'm an incoming junior at Orleans Jr. Sr. High School.  </p>
      <p class="aboutmep"> My coding Journey started back in 2018,
        or in my 6th grade year when I first learned about how the games I played everyday were created. 
      This really sparked a fire under me to figure out how it worked.  My first real project with it 
    started in 2021, when I took my schools computer science class</p>
